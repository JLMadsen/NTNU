Using std::stof to cast a string to float results in the web server crashing.
This code can be found in http_server.cpp, 765.

This implementation does not check for null, string, or large numbers.

Sending in a: GET / HTTP/string
Will result in Invalid argument exception.

Changing std::stof to string comparison and null check will fix this problem.
